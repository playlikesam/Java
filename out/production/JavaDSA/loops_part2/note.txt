// Unstructured Programming :

1. in unstructured style of programming, large or complex programs are coded as a single continuous
   block of code. it makes program code hardly readable. Hence, it is difficult to modify and debug.
2. Support limited basic data types.
3. Programs are executed sequentially and uses unstructured control statements such as goto.
4. suitable only for small and simple projects.
5. Example, earlier versions of Basic, Cobol and Fortran.

// Structured Programming :

1. In Structured Programming, large or complex programs are converted into smaller blocks of code so that
   managing the code becomes easy. Producing readable code.
2. Hence, it is easier to modify and debug. Supports variety of Data types.
3. Programs are executed Sequentially and uses Structured control statements such as if/else/for/while/etc.
4. Suitable for large and complex Projects.
5. These blocks of code are implemented as functions.
6. Therefore, a function is a block of code or collection of statements grouped together to perform a certain
   tasks or operation.
7. However, the block of code only runs/executes when the function is called.
8. Example, C,C++, Visual Basic, etc.
